# rekor-phren

## What is this?
The goal of phren is to transform the output of the [rekor](http://github.com/sigstore/rekor) into a parsable format and 
store it in BigQuery.

## How does it work?
```mermaid
graph TD
    A[phren] -->|Gets a specific rekor entry| B(rekor server)
    B --> K[entry]
    K --> C{what type it is?}
    C -->|decode| D[rekord]
    C -->|decode| E[hashedrekord]
    C -->|decode| F[intoto]
    D -->G{what type of pulic key}
    G -->|decode| H[pgp]
    G -->|decode| I[x509]
    E -->|decode| I[x509]
    F -->|decode| I[x509]
    C -->|decode| J[Other]
    J -->|store| L[BigQuery/GCPBuckets]
    I -->|store| L[BigQuery/GCPBuckets]
    H -->|store| L[BigQuery/GCPBuckets]
    
```

The rekor-phren takes the rekor data and does some ETL on it to make it easier to work with.

## Public data
The data is available via BigQuery and can be queried using SQL `SELECT * FROM openssf.phren.phren LIMIT 1000`

The BigQuery table is updated frequently(everyday). The BigQuery table is also available via the OpenSSF public dataset. 
This is a public dataset and anyone can query it.
